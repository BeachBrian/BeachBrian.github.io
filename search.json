(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\n\nAfter a 23-18 start to the 2022-2023 NBA season, The Indiana Pacers struggled down the stretch, only winning 12 of their last 41 games and finishing with a 35-47 record. Indiana somehow managed to miss both the playoff race and Wembenyama tank race by a wide margin, but several young players had flashes of success including real — not just wannabe — All-Star Tyrese Haliburton and rookies Bennedict Mathurin and Andrew Nembhard.\nEarly in the season, some fans had hopes Bennedict Mathurin could win Rookie of the Year, despite coming off the bench as a sixth man the entire year. While that honor will likely go to Orlando Magic power forward Paolo Banchero, many Pacers fans were disappointed that Mathurin was not selected as one of the three Rookie of the Year finalists. Instead, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams and Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler joined Banchero as finalists.\nThis led Barstool Indy — and no doubt thousands of other Pacers fans — to wonder if the national media is sleeping on Mathurin and the Pacers.\nAndrew Nembhard led all rookies in assists, and he was a part of the Rookie of the Year conversation early in the year, though he faded from the mainstream conversation as the season went on.\nSo how did the Pacers actually compare to the three Rookie of the Year finalists in the 2022-2023 season?\nBased on a combination of points, rebounds and assists, it is clear that Banchero should be the heavy favorite, but Kessler’s dominant rebounding and Williams’ balanced stat sheet give each a strong claim as finalists.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\nlogs23 <- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2023)\n\nrookies <- logs23 %>% \n

than Williams. Based on points, rebounds, assists and minutes alone, Mathurin had a strong case to be named as a finalist.\nWhile Nembhard had the most assists of all rookies, he still fell short of all other finalists in points and rebounds, so it is much more difficult to make the case for Nembhard, despite his solid year.\nPerhaps recency bias played a role in the selection of finalists, leaving Mathurin off the list. While the Haitian shooting guard started off the season strong — along with the entire Pacers organization — he was less consistent, especially once the playoffs seemed out of reach in March.\n\n\nCode\nbennavgpts <- bennbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nandrewavgpts <- andrewbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\npaoloavgpts <- paolobox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nwalkeravgpts <- walkerbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\njalenavgpts <- jalenbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nbennavgpt <- bennbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-1-8\")\n\nandrewavgpt <- andrewbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-2-23\")\n\npaoloavgpt <- paolobox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2022-12-23\")\n\nwalkeravgpt <- walkerbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-2-15\")\n\njalenavgpt <- jalenbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-1-10\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=bennavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#002D62\") +\n  geom_line(data=andrewavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#FDBB30\") +\n  geom_line(data=jalenavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#EF3B24\") +\n  geom_line(data=paoloavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#0077C0\") +\n  geom_line(data=walkeravgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#753BBD\") +\n  geom_text(data=paoloavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=bennavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=andrewavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=walkeravgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=jalenavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(title=\"Mathurin's scoring slump may have hurt ROY finalist chance\", subtitle = \"Nembhard's late season surge not enough to enter into Rookie of the Year conversation\", x=\"Game date\", y=\"PPG 8-game rolling average\",  caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Brian Beach\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nSure enough, Mathurin held steady as the number two scoring rookie in the league for most of the season and surged toward the end of January. However, Mathurin’s rolling average of points per game dropped significantly in February and March, while Jalen Williams caught fire. Mathurin had more points per game over the course of the season, but Williams played well when it mattered most, helping the Thunder sneak into a play-in spot.\nThere are plenty of advanced metrics out there today, but points and rebounds remain the standard summary of a player’s success. When plotting each NBA player’s season totals in both statistics, it is clear that Banchero was the best rookie of the five in the analysis, though he is nowhere near the league’s elite.\nMathurin is the closest to Banchero’s dot, and though he did not have as many rebounds as Kessler or Williams, his position on the scatter plot appears more favorable. Andrew Nembhard did a fine job taking over for the injured Haliburton late in the season, but it was clearly not nearly enough for a Rookie of the Year nomination.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nbatotals,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"lightgrey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=benn,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=benn, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=andrew,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=andrew, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=walker,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=walker, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=paolo,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=paolo, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=jalen,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=jalen, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(title=\"Mathurin's stats are closer to Banchero than Kessler and Williams \", subtitle = \"Nembhard well behind ROY finalists in points and rebound categories\", x=\"Total Points\", y=\"Total Rebounds\",  caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Brian Beach\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nMathurin, Kessler and Williams each have a strong case to be considered as Rookie of the Year finalists, but only two were able to receive the honor.\nAs a biased Pacers fan, I would say that Mathurin was snubbed, but Jazz and Thunder fans would likely be saying the same thing if their young stars weren’t selected — especially since all three teams are in relatively small media markets often overlooked by the national sports analysts."
