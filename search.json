    "text": "The Indiana Pacers did not have much success on the court this year, finishing with a 35-47 record — somehow managing to miss the playoff race and the Wembenyama tank race by a wide margin. However, there were a few bright spots for the squad from Indianapolis this year as rookies Bennedict Mathurin and Andrew Nembhard had solid seasons. With other young stars including Tyrese Haliburton, Aaron Nesmith and Jalen Smith, the future looks bright in Indiana.\nEarly in the season, some fans had hopes Bennedict Mathurin could win Rookie of the Year, despite coming off the bench as a sixth man the entire year. While that honor will likely go to Orlando Magic power forward Paolo Banchero, many Pacers fans were disappointed that Mathurin was not selected as one of the three rookie of the year finalists. Instead, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams and Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler joined Banchero as finalists.\nThis led Barstool Indy — and no doubt thousands of other Pacers fans — to wonder if the national media is sleeping on Indiana.\nAndrew Nembhard also received plenty of playing time, especially after Haliburton’s injury. He led all rookies in assists, but did not receive much attention in the Rookie of the Year race.\nSo how did the Pacers actually compare to the three rookie of the year finalists in the 2022-2023 season?\nBased on a combination of points, rebounds and assists, it is clear that Banchero should be the heavy favorite, but Kessler’s dominant rebounding and Williams’ balanced stat sheet give each a strong claim as finalists.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nlogs23 <- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2023)\n\nrookies <- logs23 %>% \n
