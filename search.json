    "text": "Bennedict Mathurin scored the second most points among NBA rookies this season, but he was not named as one of the three Rookie of the Year Finalists. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\n\nAfter a 23-18 start to the 2022-2023 NBA season, The Indiana Pacers struggled down the stretch, only winning 12 of their last 41 games and finishing with a 35-47 record. Indiana somehow managed to miss both the playoff race and Wembenyama tank race by a wide margin, but several young players had flashes of success including real — not just wannabe — All-Star Tyrese Haliburton and rookies Bennedict Mathurin and Andrew Nembhard.\nEarly in the season, some fans had hopes Bennedict Mathurin could win Rookie of the Year, despite coming off the bench as a sixth man the entire year. While that honor will likely go to Orlando Magic power forward Paolo Banchero, many Pacers fans were disappointed that Mathurin was not selected as one of the three Rookie of the Year finalists. Instead, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams and Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler joined Banchero as finalists.\nThis led Barstool Indy — and no doubt thousands of other Pacers fans — to wonder if the national media is sleeping on Mathurin and the Pacers.\nAndrew Nembhard led all rookies in assists, and he was a part of the Rookie of the Year conversation early in the year, though he faded from the mainstream conversation as the season went on.\nSo how did the Pacers actually compare to the three Rookie of the Year finalists in the 2022-2023 season?\nBased on a combination of points, rebounds and assists, it is clear that Banchero should be the heavy favorite, but Kessler’s dominant rebounding and Williams’ balanced stat sheet give each a strong claim as finalists.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\nlogs23 <- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2023)\n\nrookies <- logs23 %>% \n

than Williams. Based on points, rebounds, assists and minutes alone, Mathurin had a strong case to be named as a finalist.\nWhile Nembhard had the most assists of all rookies, he still fell short of all other finalists in points and rebounds, so it is much more difficult to make the case for Nembhard, despite his solid year.\nPerhaps recency bias played a role in the selection of finalists, leaving Mathurin off the list. While the Haitian shooting guard started off the season strong — along with the entire Pacers organization — he was less consistent, especially once the playoffs seemed out of reach in March.\n\n\nCode\nbennavgpts <- bennbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nandrewavgpts <- andrewbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\npaoloavgpts <- paolobox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nwalkeravgpts <- walkerbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\njalenavgpts <- jalenbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left'))\n\nbennavgpt <- bennbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-1-8\")\n\nandrewavgpt <- andrewbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-2-23\")\n\npaoloavgpt <- paolobox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2022-12-23\")\n\nwalkeravgpt <- walkerbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-2-15\")\n\njalenavgpt <- jalenbox %>% \n  mutate(rolling_avg = rollmean(points, k=8, fill=NA, align='left')) %>% \n  filter(game_date == \"2023-1-10\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=bennavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#002D62\") +\n  geom_line(data=andrewavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#FDBB30\") +\n  geom_line(data=jalenavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#EF3B24\") +\n  geom_line(data=paoloavgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#0077C0\") +\n  geom_line(data=walkeravgpts, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg), color=\"#753BBD\") +\n  geom_text(data=paoloavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=bennavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=andrewavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text(data=walkeravgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=jalenavgpt, aes(x=game_date, y=rolling_avg, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(title=\"Mathurin's scoring slump may have hurt ROY finalist chance\", subtitle = \"Nembhard's late season surge not enough to enter into Rookie of the Year conversation\", x=\"Game date\", y=\"PPG 8-game rolling average\",  caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Brian Beach\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nSure enough, Mathurin held steady as the number two scoring rookie in the league for most of the season and surged toward the end of January. However, Mathurin’s rolling average of points per game dropped significantly in February and March, while Jalen Williams caught fire. Mathurin had more points per game over the course of the season, but Williams played well when it mattered most, helping the Thunder sneak into a play-in spot.\nThere are plenty of advanced metrics out there today, but points and rebounds remain the standard summary of a player’s success. When plotting each NBA player’s season totals in both statistics, it is clear that Banchero was the best rookie of the five in the analysis, though he is nowhere near the league’s elite.\nMathurin is the closest to Banchero’s dot, and though he did not have as many rebounds as Kessler or Williams, his position on the scatter plot appears more favorable. Andrew Nembhard did a fine job taking over for the injured Haliburton late in the season, but it was clearly not nearly enough for a Rookie of the Year nomination.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nbatotals,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"lightgrey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=benn,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=benn, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=andrew,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=andrew, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=walker,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=walker, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=paolo,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=paolo, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=jalen,\n    aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds), color=\"red\"\n  ) + geom_text_repel(data=jalen, aes(x=TotalPoints, y=TotalRebounds, label=athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(title=\"Mathurin's stats are closer to Banchero than Kessler and Williams \", subtitle = \"Nembhard well behind ROY finalists in points and rebound categories\", x=\"Total Points\", y=\"Total Rebounds\",  caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Brian Beach\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nMathurin, Kessler and Williams each have a strong case to be considered as Rookie of the Year finalists, but only two were able to receive the honor.\nAs a biased Pacers fan, I would say that Mathurin was snubbed, but Jazz and Thunder fans would likely be saying the same thing if their young stars weren’t selected — especially since all three teams are in relatively small media markets often overlooked by the national sports analysts."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some NBA fans get to spend the month of May watching their team take part in a heated playoff series on national television.\nFor others, May is a month to spend several hours combing through social media data and writing code to determine which players are underrated and deserve more respect the following year.\nOver the last few seasons, fans of the Indiana Pacers have been part of the latter category. And when they’re not busy crying about how one of their rookies wasn’t a Rookie of the Year finalist, many are often seen finding alternative methods to complain about how their players are consistently overlooked and underrated.\nOne of the most straightforward ways to determine a player’s popularity in the league is the number of Instagram followers they have.\nThanks to a website with the suspiciously straightforward title —popularbasketballers.com — that number is easily accessible for 443 professional basketball players as of April 25, 2023.\nUnsurprisingly, LeBron James with his more than 150 million Instagram followers lead the league, with Steph Curry’s 50 million in a distant second place. The third highest follower count belongs to Russell Westbrook with around 22 million, making both LeBron and Steph substantial outliers in the league.\nHowever, even after removing the two most popular players in the league from the dataset, Lakers and Warriors players have the highest number of average Instagram followers of any team. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers have the second lowest average in the league, with just over 200,000 followers. That may seem like a lot to a normal person, but that number is significantly low for an NBA player. Only the San Antonio Spurs have a lower average follower count.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(cluster)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nfollowersurl <- \"https://www.popularbasketballers.com/\"\n\nfollowers <- followersurl %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"myTable\"]') %>% \n  html_table()\n\nfollowersdf <- followers[[1]]\n\nlogs23 <- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2023)\n\nseason23 <- logs23 %>%  \n  filter(minutes>0) %>% \n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    AvgPoints = mean(points),\n    AvgRebounds = mean(rebounds),\n    AvgAssists = mean(assists),\n    AvgMinutes = mean(minutes),\n    AvgSteals = mean(steals),\n    Team = team_name\n  )\n\nlogsig <- season23 %>% \n  left_join(followersdf, by=c(\"athlete_display_name\" = \"Name\"))\n\ngoodlogsig <- logsig %>% \n  filter(`Instagram Followers`>0)\n\nbetterlogsig <- goodlogsig %>% mutate(`Instagram Followers`=gsub(\",\",\"\",`Instagram Followers`)) %>% \n  mutate(`Instagram Followers` = as.numeric(`Instagram Followers`))\n\nteamsig <- betterlogsig %>%\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    PlayerAccounts = n(),\n    AvgIgFollowers = mean(`Instagram Followers`),\n    TotalIgFollowers = sum(`Instagram Followers`)\n  )\n\navgigbyteam <- betterlogsig %>% \n  group_by(Team) %>% \n  summarise(\n    AverageFollowers = mean(`Instagram Followers`)\n  ) %>% \n  filter(Team != \"Team LeBron\" &\n         Team != \"Team Giannis\") %>% \n  arrange(desc(AverageFollowers))\n\nbestlogsig <- betterlogsig %>% \n  filter(athlete_display_name != \"LeBron James\" &\n         athlete_display_name != \"Stephen Curry\")\n\navgigbyteam2 <- bestlogsig %>% \n  group_by(Team) %>% \n  summarise(\n    AverageFollowers = mean(`Instagram Followers`)\n  ) %>% \n  filter(Team != \"Team LeBron\" &\n         Team != \"Team Giannis\") %>% \n  arrange(desc(AverageFollowers))\n\npacers <- avgigbyteam2 %>% \nfilter(Team == \"Pacers\")\n\nlakers <- avgigbyteam2 %>% \nfilter(Team == \"Lakers\")\n\nwarriors <- avgigbyteam2 %>% \nfilter(Team == \"Warriors\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=avgigbyteam2, \n    aes(x=reorder(Team, AverageFollowers),\n        weight=AverageFollowers), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=pacers, \n    aes(x=reorder(Team, AverageFollowers),\n        weight=AverageFollowers), fill=\"#002D62\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=lakers, \n    aes(x=reorder(Team, AverageFollowers),\n        weight=AverageFollowers), fill=\"#552583\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=warriors, \n    aes(x=reorder(Team, AverageFollowers),\n        weight=AverageFollowers), fill=\"#FFC72C\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(title=\"Pacers rank 29th in average player Instagram popularity\", subtitle = \"Even without LeBron and Steph, Lakers and Warriors players lead the NBA in average IG followers.\",  x=\"\", y=\"Instagram Followers\", caption = \"Source: hoopR & popularbasketballers.com | By Brian Beach\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer success on the court is linked to high follower counts online, but the link is not nearly as strong as some may expect.

but upon further inspection, the dataset included the follower count from Harden’s old account from 2017. James Harden’s current account has around 12 million followers, nearly 40 times more than Haliburton’s total.\nThere are also additional issues with determining a team’s popularity solely from Instagram. For example, two-time league MVP Nikola Jókic does not have an Instagram page at all while Ja Morant recently deactivated his account and is not part of the dataset.\nUnlike the NBA playoffs, the results of this analysis are not to be taken too seriously, but it is clear that the Indiana Pacers lack the league-wide popularity other players enjoy, despite producing similar outcomes on the court."
